# Zap-It
Demo of top score challenge game.

Idea:
a ball spawns from the center of the screen into a random direction, if the ball passes the edge of the screen you lose.

To score you have to "Zap" the ball by creating two points on the screen by clicking, the line in between destroys the ball and increases your score by 1.

Each successful "zap" increases the speed of the ball so it is harder with each spawn.

The goal is to score the highest possible score.
